#+title: Emacs Configuration
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ./init.el :mkdirp yes

* Welcome!

This is the configuration we've been building in the *Emacs From Scratch* series, now written as an Org Mode document.  This file generates [[file:init.el][init.el]] which can be loaded by Emacs at startup.

*NOTE:* If you run into any issues while using this configuration, please [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/issues/new][file an issue]] or send me an email at =david at systemcrafters.cc=.

The following variables are used to tweak some of the configuration pieces for use in the live streams so you might need to adjust them for your local machine if you try to use this configuration directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; NOTE: init.el is now generated from Emacs.org.  Please edit that file
;;       in Emacs and init.el will be generated automatically!

;; You will most likely need to adjust this font size for your system!
(defvar efs/default-font-size 180)
(defvar efs/default-variable-font-size 140)

* Tips for Use

In this document I've added links in many places that lead you to documentation for the various packages we use.  If you're looking at this file in Emacs, you can put your cursor on a link and press =C-c C-o= or run =M-x org-open-at-point= to open the link in your web browser.

* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

#+end_src

* Basic UI Configuration

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

  (scroll-bar-mode -1)        ; Disable visible scrollbar
  (tool-bar-mode -1)          ; Disable the toolbar
  (tooltip-mode -1)           ; Disable tooltips
  (set-fringe-mode 10)        ; Give some breathing room

  (menu-bar-mode -1)            ; Disable the menu bar

  ;; Set up the visible bell
  (setq visible-bell t)

  (column-number-mode)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

  ;; Disable line numbers for some modes
  (dolist (mode '(org-mode-hook
                  term-mode-hook
                  shell-mode-hook
                  eshell-mode-hook))
    (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

** Font Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the fixed pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size)

;; Set the variable pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size :weight 'regular)

* Keybinding Configuration

* UI Configuration

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package doom-themes
  :init (load-theme 'doom-dracula t))

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package doom-modeline
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom ((doom-modeline-height 15)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (use-package ivy
      :diminish
      :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
             :map ivy-minibuffer-map
             ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
             ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-l" . ivy-done)
             ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
             :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
             ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
             ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
      :config
      (ivy-mode 1))

    (use-package ivy-rich
      :init
      (ivy-rich-mode 1))

    (use-package counsel
      :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
             :map minibuffer-local-map
             ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
      :config
      (counsel-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Text Scaling

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s t s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hydra)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))

  (rune/leader-keys
    "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

#+end_src

* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

** Better Font Faces

The =efs/org-font-setup= function configures various text faces to tweak the sizes of headings and use variable width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document in =org-mode=.  We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                            '(("^ *\\([-]\\) "
                               (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

    ;; Set faces for heading levels
    (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.2)
                    (org-level-2 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-3 . 1.05)
                    (org-level-4 . 1.0)
                    (org-level-5 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-6 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-7 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-8 . 1.1)))
      (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'regular :height (cdr face)))

    ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in Org files appears that way
    (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-verbatim nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-special-keyword nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-checkbox nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch))

** Basic Config

This section contains the basic configuration for =org-mode= plus the configuration for Org agendas and capture templates.  There's a lot to unpack in here so I'd recommend watching the videos for [[https://youtu.be/VcgjTEa0kU4][Part 5]] and [[https://youtu.be/PNE-mgkZ6HM][Part 6]] for a full explanation.

*** Nicer Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in =org-mode= buffers with nicer looking characters that you can control.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]] which we may cover in a later video.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-bullets

#+end_src

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-mode-visual-fill ()
    (setq visual-fill-column-width 100
          visual-fill-column-center-text t)

#+end_src

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (org-babel-do-load-languages

** Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =efs/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the Emacs.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically tangle our Emacs.org config file when we save it
  (defun efs/org-babel-tangle-config ()
    (when (string-equal (buffer-file-name)
                        (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.org"))
      ;; Dynamic scoping to the rescue

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package projectile

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.
