#+title: Emacs Configuration
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ./init.el :mkdirp yes

* Welcome!
The following variables are used to tweak some of the configuration pieces for use in the live streams so you might need to adjust them for your local machine if you try to use this configuration directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: init.el is now generated from init.org.  Please edit that file
  ;;       in Emacs and init.el will be generated automatically!
  ;; You will most likely need to adjust this font size for your system!
  (defvar efs/default-font-size 140)
  (defvar efs/default-variable-font-size 120)

#+end_src

* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

#+end_src

* Basic UI Configuration

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

    (scroll-bar-mode -1)        ; Disable visible scrollbar
    (tool-bar-mode -1)          ; Disable the toolbar
    (tooltip-mode -1)           ; Disable tooltips
    (set-fringe-mode 10)        ; Give some breathing room

    (menu-bar-mode -1)            ; Disable the menu bar

    ;; Set up the visible bell
    (setq visible-bell t)

    (column-number-mode)
    (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

    ;; Disable line numbers for some modes
    (dolist (mode '(org-mode-hook
                    term-mode-hook
                    shell-mode-hook
                    eshell-mode-hook
		    treemacs-mode-hook))
      (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

** Font Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size)

  ;; Set the fixed pitch face
  (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size)

  ;; Set the variable pitch face
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :height efs/default-font-size :weight 'regular)

#+end_src

* Autosave

I really dislike the basic emacs autosave behaviour, so let's make it better. This puts all autosave and backup files neatly away in my home directory, therefore not polluting my work directories.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Put backup files neatly away
  (let ((backup-dir "~/tmp/emacs/backups")
        (auto-saves-dir "~/tmp/emacs/auto-saves/"))
    (dolist (dir (list backup-dir auto-saves-dir))
      (when (not (file-directory-p dir))
        (make-directory dir t)))
    (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,backup-dir))
          auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,auto-saves-dir t))
          auto-save-list-file-prefix (concat auto-saves-dir ".saves-")
          tramp-backup-directory-alist `((".*" . ,backup-dir))
          tramp-auto-save-directory auto-saves-dir))

  (setq backup-by-copying t    ; Don't delink hardlinks
        delete-old-versions t  ; Clean up the backups
        version-control t      ; Use version numbers on backups,
        kept-new-versions 5    ; keep some new versions
        kept-old-versions 2)   ; and some old ones, too

#+end_src

This sets up proper autosave, reducing my need spam save manually.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (auto-save-visited-mode)
  (setq auto-save-visited-interval 3)
  
#+end_src

* Keybinding Configuration

** General

The general package allows for easy keybindings configurations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package general)
    
#+end_src

* UI Configuration

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package doom-themes
    :init (load-theme 'doom-outrun-electric t))

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you may need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly. This should only be required if you do not use a nerdfont.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package all-the-icons)

  (use-package doom-modeline
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    :custom ((doom-modeline-height 15)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package which-key
    :init (which-key-mode)
    :diminish which-key-mode
    :config
    (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package ivy
    :diminish
    :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
           :map ivy-minibuffer-map
           ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-l" . ivy-done)
           ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
           :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
    :config
    (ivy-mode 1))

  (use-package ivy-rich
    :init
    (ivy-rich-mode 1))

  (use-package counsel
    :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
           :map minibuffer-local-map
           ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
    :config
    (counsel-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Text Scaling

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s t s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package hydra)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))
#+end_src

* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

** Better Font Faces

The =efs/org-font-setup= function configures various text faces to tweak the sizes of headings and use variable width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document in =org-mode=.  We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (defun efs/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                            '(("^ *\\([-]\\) "
                               (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

    ;; Set faces for heading levels
    (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.2)
                    (org-level-2 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-3 . 1.05)
                    (org-level-4 . 1.0)
                    (org-level-5 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-6 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-7 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-8 . 1.1)))
      (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'regular :height (cdr face)))

    ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in Org files appears that way
    (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil   :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-verbatim nil :inherit '(shadow fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-special-keyword nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-meta-line nil :inherit '(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))
    (set-face-attribute 'org-checkbox nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch))

** Basic Config

This section contains the basic configuration for =org-mode= plus the configuration for Org agendas and capture templates.  There's a lot to unpack in here so I'd recommend watching the videos for [[https://youtu.be/VcgjTEa0kU4][Part 5]] and [[https://youtu.be/PNE-mgkZ6HM][Part 6]] for a full explanation.

*** Nicer Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in =org-mode= buffers with nicer looking characters that you can control.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]] which we may cover in a later video.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-bullets

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (org-babel-do-load-languages

** Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =efs/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the init.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Languages

*** IDE Features with lsp-mode

**** lsp-mode

We use the excellent [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] to enable IDE-like functionality for many different programming languages via "language servers" that speak the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]].  Before trying to set up =lsp-mode= for a particular language, check out the [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/][documentation for your language]] so that you can learn which language servers are available and how to install them.

The =lsp-keymap-prefix= setting enables you to define a prefix for where =lsp-mode='s default keybindings will be added.  I *highly recommend* using the prefix to find out what you can do with =lsp-mode= in a buffer.

The =which-key= integration adds helpful descriptions of the various keys so you should be able to learn a lot just by pressing =C-l= in a =lsp-mode= buffer and trying different things that you find there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/lsp-mode-setup ()

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-ui/][lsp-ui]] is a set of UI enhancements built on top of =lsp-mode= which make Emacs feel even more like an IDE.  Check out the screenshots on the =lsp-ui= homepage (linked at the beginning of this paragraph) to see examples of what it can do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ui
    :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)
    :custom
    (lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom))

**** lsp-treemacs

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]] provides nice tree views for different aspects of your code like symbols in a file, references of a symbol, or diagnostic messages (errors and warnings) that are found in your code.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-treemacs-symbols= - Show a tree view of the symbols in the current file
- =lsp-treemacs-references= - Show a tree view for the references of the symbol under the cursor
- =lsp-treemacs-error-list= - Show a tree view for the diagnostic messages in the project

This package is built on the [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]] package which might be of some interest to you if you like to have a file browser at the left side of your screen in your editor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-treemacs
    :after lsp)

#+end_src

Some more keybindings for treemacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package treemacs
    :bind (("C-<tab>" . treemacs)))

#+end_src

**** lsp-ivy

[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] integrates Ivy with =lsp-mode= to make it easy to search for things by name in your code.  When you run these commands, a prompt will appear in the minibuffer allowing you to type part of the name of a symbol in your code.  Results will be populated in the minibuffer so that you can find what you're looking for and jump to that location in the code upon selecting the result.

Try these commands with =M-x=:

- =lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in the current project workspace
- =lsp-ivy-global-workspace-symbol= - Search for a symbol name in all active project workspaces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package lsp-ivy)

**** Debugging with dap-mode

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][dap-mode]] is an excellent package for bringing rich debugging capabilities to Emacs via the [[https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/][Debug Adapter Protocol]].  You should check out the [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/][configuration docs]] to learn how to configure the debugger for your language.  Also make sure to check out the documentation for the debug adapter to see what configuration parameters are available to use for your debug templates!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package dap-mode
    ;; Uncomment the config below if you want all UI panes to be hidden by default!
    ;; :custom
    ;; (lsp-enable-dap-auto-configure nil)
    ;; :config
    ;; (dap-ui-mode 1)

    :config
    ;; Set up Node debugging
    (require 'dap-node)
    (dap-node-setup) ;; Automatically installs Node debug adapter if needed

    ;; Bind `C-c l d` to `dap-hydra` for easy access
    (general-define-key
      :keymaps 'lsp-mode-map
      :prefix lsp-keymap-prefix
      "d" '(dap-hydra t :wk "debugger")))

#+end_src 
*** Python

The following provides language server support for Python using pylsp. Make sure that it is installed on the system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package python-mode
    :ensure t
    :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
    :custom
    ;; NOTE: Set these if Python 3 is called "python3" on your system!
    ;; (python-shell-interpreter "python3")
    ;; (dap-python-executable "python3")
    (dap-python-debugger 'debugpy)
    :config
    (require 'dap-python))

#+end_src

**** Micromamba

I mainly use micromamba to manage my Python environments using [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/micromamba.el][emacs-micromamba]] allows to get support within emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package micromamba)

#+end_src

*** Nix
This will activate [[https://github.com/NixOS/nix-mode][nix-mode]] for all .nix files

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package nix-mode
    :mode "\\.nix\\'"
    :hook (nix-mode . lsp-deferred)
    )

#+end_src
** Jupyter

This automatically convert notebooks to org files so they're easier to edit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq code-cells-convert-ipynb-style '(
          ("pandoc" "--to" "ipynb" "--from" "org")
          ("pandoc" "--to" "org" "--from" "ipynb")
          org-mode))
  
#+end_src

We need to install the [[https://github.com/emacs-jupyter/jupyter][emacs-jupyter]] package to interact with the running Jupyter kernel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package jupyter)

  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((jupyter . t)))
  
#+end_src
** Company Mode

[[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company Mode]] provides a nicer in-buffer completion interface than =completion-at-point= which is more reminiscent of what you would expect from an IDE.  We add a simple configuration to make the keybindings a little more useful (=TAB= now completes the selection and initiates completion at the current location if needed).

We also use [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box][company-box]] to further enhance the look of the completions with icons and better overall presentation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package company
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
    :bind (:map company-active-map
           ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
          (:map lsp-mode-map
           ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
    :custom
    (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
    (company-idle-delay 0.0))

  (use-package company-box
    :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))

#+end_src

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config (projectile-mode)
    :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
    :init
    ;; NOTE: Set this to the folder where you keep your Git repos!
    (when (file-directory-p "~/code")
      (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/code")))
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired))

  (use-package counsel-projectile
    :config (counsel-projectile-mode))

#+end_src

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the best Git interface I've ever used.  Common Git operations are easy to execute quickly using Magit's command panel system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package magit
    :custom
    (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))
  
  ;; NOTE: Make sure to configure a GitHub token before using this package!
  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation
  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html#Getting-Started
  (use-package forge)

#+end_src

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

#+end_src

** Smartparens

[[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] is awesome for handling parens pair automatically

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package smartparens
      :ensure smartparens  ;; install the package
      :hook (prog-mode text-mode markdown-mode org-mode) ;; add `smartparens-mode` to these hooks
      :config
      ;; load default config
      (require 'smartparens-config))
  
#+end_src

* TRAMP

I need TRAMP to work really well as I mostly work directly on the university cluster. For that, I need to add some more folders to the PATH (LSP ones for example).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-path-with-local-bin
    '((tramp-remote-path . ("~/.local/bin" tramp-default-remote-path))))


  (connection-local-set-profiles
    '(:application tramp :machine "izblisbon.unibe.ch") 'remote-path-with-local-bin)
